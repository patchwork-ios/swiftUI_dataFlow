    /// SwiftUI lends itself well to the MVVM pattern (Model - View - ViewModel).
    /// MVVM is where there is a View binds with a ViewModel, which updates the Model layer. For SwiftUI, MVVM looks like this, where you have a model object for the View and that model object publishes it's variables so the View can bind to those published variables.
    /// For some situations (like the `BudgetCell` and the `BudgetDetailView`) you can just pass in an `ObservedObject` and that works fine. But the line below this does not compile, because Array does not coform to `ObservedObject` currently. But if we put that array in a ViewModel class and make that array `@Published` then we can get the proper bindings to it.
    /// You might be thinking, well lets make the array an `@Binding`, which would compile! If that's what you're thinking, then try it! You'll run into some problems, though...
    /// Using @Binding works, but makes it hard to get in to this page without originating from an `@State`, which we don't really want our original list to be. `@State` should only be accessible within the View it is declared (and its subviews via `@Binding`), thus it should always be declared `private`: `@State private var myVar: SomeType`.
    /// I said "`@Binding` makes it hard to get to this page without originating from an `@State`". To explain that... the only way to get an `@Binding` to an `ObservableObject` that I have found thus far is to create an `@State` array of your `ObservableObject` type and then pass in the binding to an item in the array. (NOTE: You can also pass in an `@ObservedObject` via that same code path, which is probably better because it is more consistent).
